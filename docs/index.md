## WHY should I waste 15 minutes of my life?

Seize the means of production.

Stocks- representing a share of ownership in one of the producing entities on capitalist society - have been one of the most consistent ways of creating a long-term passive income stream.

Stocks consistently return around 7% after inflation historically.

This means in 20 years, you will have ~4x what you originally put in. Even better, you can support a 3% withdrawal rate in perpetuity. That means that if you have 2000 dollars invested, you can get 60 dollars per year forever! If you have 100,000, that’s 6000 per year forever!

The most common way to access stocks is through a retirement portfolio. There, you should invest in index funds, which represent a broad slice of the market.  This diversification across a wide range of assets is the best way to ensure you get consistent 7% (post-inflation) returns seen by the market as a whole.

The problem with index funds is that they invest in the entire index of the stock market. Some companies in the stock market may be doing evil things that you don’t want to support. OR you may have specific knowledge that makes you think some stocks will do better.

Instead of investing in an index fund, you can use new brokerages that offer no-cost trading to create portfolios that match indexes but are customized! Frr example, you could exclude oil companies, if you think oil is bad.

This also means that you actually own stock in these companies, and if you wanted, could vote and do other cool owner things. That makes you bourgeoisie. Being bourgeoisie is the American dream.

## Basic Usage

Click ‘add portfolio’ to create your first portfolio. Add a dashing name.

Groups of stocks that you are purchasing are called `portfolios`. A single brokerage
can be attached to a single portfolio, but a portfolio can contain multiple brokerages.

Often, you will just have a `paper` and `real` portfolio.

Now you need to connect to a brokerage that lets you buy and hold stocks.

We suggest Alpaca, which you’ll set up next.


## Alpaca Setup
Go to https://alpaca.markets/ 

Sign up. You don’t need to connect any bank account info to get a paper account. If you get far enough in the flow for it to prompt you about that, just use the sidebar to click out.

Paper account lets you trade using paper money. Should look like the below. Note paer in the top left.


Generate an API key in sidebar on right, save it.


Go back to your portfolio. Click add provider. Select ‘alpaca paper’ as the type, add in your key and secret. Click ‘save login info’.


Mess around with indexes
Now that you’re connected, click ‘configure’ to mess around with what index you want to use. For example, you could pick the sp500 or large cap stocks.



Configuring

Within the configuration screen, you can select an index to build against. You can also customize this index by adding/removing/reweighting particular stocks or lists of stocks.
