# Installation

Fundiverse is a electron desktop app with versions for windows, mac, and linux.

You install the app, and then locally configure it to connect to your brokerage. Fundiverse does not
communicate with anything other than your configered brokerages.

Fundiverse will communicate with your broker to determine what stocks you hold, and then determine
what orders to place to help build your customized index. It will then place those orders for you
when you submit.
