# Installation

### Open Source Platform

Fundiverse is a electron desktop app with versions for windows, mac, and linux. You download and run it like any other app.

::: tip
Electron is a common packaging format for distributing apps across windows/mac/linux platforms. It is used by many popular tools such as Slack, Discord, and Visual Studio Code.

### Data Stays With You

You install the app, and then locally configure it to connect to your brokerage by providing it with API keys. Your compute directly talks to the brokerages. Fundiverse does not communicate with anything other than your configered brokerages.

### Bring your Own Brokerage

Fundiverse will use your brokerage to determine what stocks you hold, their current prices, and other market information and then determine
what orders to place to help build your customized index. It will then place those orders for you given rules you define.

### Get Started Quickly

A portfolio will be set up with a target size and can either be fully funded or built towards over time. A portfolio can be revisited to be rebalanced or to add more funds.

::: tip
Your portfolio can even span multiple brokerages!
