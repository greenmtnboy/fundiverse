# Installation

Fundiverse is a electron desktop app with versions for windows, mac, and linux. Electron is a common packaging format for multi-platform distribution. It is used by many popular apps such as Slack, Discord, and Visual Studio Code.

You install the app, and then locally configure it to connect to your brokerage by providing it with API keys. Fundiverse does not
communicate with anything other than your configered brokerages.

Fundiverse will use your brokerage to determine what stocks you hold, their current prices, and other market information and then determine
what orders to place to help build your customized index. It will then place those orders for you given rules you define.

A portfolio will be set up with a target size and can either be fully funded or built towards over time. A portfolio can be revisited to be rebalanced or to add more funds.
