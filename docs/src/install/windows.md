## Direct Download

The windows intaller can be downloaded directly from the [github release page](https://github.com/greenmtnboy/fundiverse/releases).

### Downloading

Open the latest release and download the EXE.

Once it is downloaded, double click on the file to install it. Windows will warn that this file is by an untrusted publisher. This is currently true; you will need to bypass this warning to install.

If it doesnâ€™t auto-run, find in start menu, run. 

### Troubleshooting

Fundiverse requires internet acccess to communicate with your brokerage. If you are behind a firewall, you may need to allow the fundiverse backend to access the internet.
