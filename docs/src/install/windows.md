## Direct Download

Windows can be downloaded directly from the github page as an installer.  

### Downloading
Go to https://github.com/greenmtnboy/fundiverse/releases

Open the latest release and download the EXE.

Once it is downloaded, double click on the file to install it. Windows will warn that this file is by an untrusted publisher. This is currently true; you will need to bypass this warning to install.

If it doesnâ€™t auto-run, find in start menu, run. 

### Troubleshooting

Fundiverse requires internet acccess to communicate with your brokerage. If you are behind a firewall, you may need to allow fundiverse to access the internet.
