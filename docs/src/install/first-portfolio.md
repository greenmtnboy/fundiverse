## Basic Usage

Click ‘add portfolio’ to create your first portfolio. Add a dashing name.

Groups of stocks that you are purchasing are called `portfolios`. A single brokerage
can be attached to a single portfolio, but a portfolio can contain multiple brokerages.

It is commont to have a `paper` and `real` portfolio.

Now you need to connect to a brokerage that lets you buy and hold stocks.

We suggest Alpaca, which you’ll set up next.


## Alpaca Setup
Go to [https://alpaca.markets/](https://alpaca.markets/)

Sign up. You don’t need to connect any bank account info to get a paper account. If you get far enough in the flow for it to prompt you about that, just use the sidebar to click out.

Paper account lets you trade using paper money. Ensure that you see 'paper' in your account info on top right.

Generate an API key in sidebar on right, save it.

Go back to your portfolio. Click add provider. Select ‘alpaca paper’ as the type, add in your key and secret. Optionally check ‘save login info’ to persist this for next time you open the app.


## Create and Customize Index

Now that you’re connected, click ‘configure’ to set the index you want to use. For example, you could pick the sp500 or large cap stocks. You can also customize this index by adding/removing/reweighting particular stocks or lists of stocks. 


## Index Customization Screen

The customization screen will show your current holdings on left, and your target holdings on right. Use the dropdown to select a new target index. Click the custom button to adjust this index further, such as by excluding some stocks or overweighting or underweighting certain lists.
