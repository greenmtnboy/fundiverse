## Why?

Fundiverse attempts to capture the best qualities of index funds - low fees, broad diversification, ease of use - while allowing you to customize your portfolio to your values and beliefs. It's the middle ground between picking stocks and picking the entire market.

::: warning
Fundiverse does not provide investment advice. It is a tool to help those with investing knowledge build a portfolio that reflects their values and beliefs. Do not invest what you cannot afford to lose. All investment decisions are your own.

## What

Your personalized index starts with an existing index as a base, which you can then customized by reweighting lists of stocks or individual stocks. Fundiverse then integrates with your brokerage to execute the orders to build your portfolio.

Use a streamlined UI to connect to your brokerages, track your holdings against the index and purchase what you need to achieve your goals.

## Philosophy

The stock market has historically been one of the most consistent ways of building long-term wealth.  
Modern stock investing emphasizes index funds for retail investers - "you can't beat the market". Fundiverse is based on the premise that this wisdom is correct; but that there is still room for personal preference and expression even when building a broadly diversified portfolio.


::: tip
 Buying the market implicitly implies supporting every publically traded company equally - there are many reasons why you may not want to do that. Fundiverse's goal is to give you the freedom to express yourself while achieving your financial goals - all with no cost.

That's why Fundiverse is built on index funds. Start with something you know works and then make it your own. For example, you can exclude oil companies, or weight them more if you think they'll out-perform the market. You could exclude Amazon, Apple, or Meta.
