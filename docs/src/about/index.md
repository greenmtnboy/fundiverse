## Why?

Fundiverse attempts to capture the best qualities of index funds - low fees, broad diversification, and ease of use - while allowing you to customize your portfolio to your values and beliefs.

## How

Fundiverse lets you select a target index to build against, and then helps you buy stocks in your brokerage to bring your account in line with the expected weights of each stock. You can customize the default provided indexes or create your own.

## Details

Stocks - representing a share of ownership in one of the producing entities on capitalist society - have historically been one of the most consistent ways of creating a long-term passive income stream.

Stocks have consistently returned around 7% after inflation historically. This is no guarantee of future performance, of course. 

This means in 20 years, you will have ~4x what you originally put in. Even better, historical analysis predicts that if you take out 3-4% of your portfolio each year, you'll never run out (even with typical market fluctuations). That means that if you have 2000 dollars invested, you can safely spend 60 dollars per year forever out of the gains of that portfolio. If you have 100,000, that’s 6,000 per year forever, and so on - this is the basis of a sustainable stock-based retirement portfolio.

The most common way to access stocks is through a retirement portfolio. There, you should invest in index funds, which represent a broad slice of the market.  This diversification across a wide range of assets is the best way to ensure you get consistent 7% (post-inflation) returns seen by the market as a whole.

The problem with index funds is that they invest in the entire index of the stock market. Some companies in the stock market may be doing evil things that you don’t want to support. OR you may have specific knowledge that makes you think some stocks will do better.

Instead of investing in an index fund, you can use modenr brokerages that offer no-cost trading to create portfolios that match indexes but are customized! For example, you could exclude oil companies, if you think oil is bad, or double down on them, if you think they'll out-perform the market. 

This also means that you actually own stock in these companies, and if you wanted, could vote and do other cool owner things. That makes you bourgeoisie. Being bourgeoisie is the American dream.
