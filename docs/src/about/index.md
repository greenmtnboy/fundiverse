## Why?

Fundiverse attempts to capture the best qualities of index funds - low fees, broad diversification, ease of use - while allowing you to customize your portfolio to your values and beliefs. It's the middle ground between picking stocks and picking the entire market.

## How

Your personalized index starts with an existing index as a base, which you can then customized by reweighting lists of stocks or individual stocks. Fundiverse then integrates with your brokerage to execute the orders to build your portfolio.

An example of the customization screen:

## Tell me More

Stocks - representing a share of ownership in one of the producing entities on capitalist society - have historically been one of the most consistent ways of building long-term wealth.

Stocks have consistently returned around 7% after inflation historically. This is no guarantee of future performance, of course.

Modern stock investing emphasizes index funds for retail investers - "you can't beat the market". Fundiverse is based on the premise that this wisdom is correct; but that there is still room for personal preference and expression even when building a broadly diversified portfolio. Buying the market implicitly implies supporting every publically traded company equally - there are many reasons why some subset may be discounted or preferred by an investor besides pure financial goals.

To enable that, Fundiverse lets you take a common index fund, and tweak it. For example, you could exclude oil companies, if you think oil is bad, or double down on them, if you think they'll out-perform the market. You could exclude Amazon, or Apple. Or every bank. Or double down on biotech.
