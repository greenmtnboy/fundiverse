## Why?

Fundiverse attempts to capture the best qualities of index funds - low fees, broad diversification, and ease of use - while allowing you to customize your portfolio to your values and beliefs.


## Details

Stocks- representing a share of ownership in one of the producing entities on capitalist society - have been one of the most consistent ways of creating a long-term passive income stream.

Stocks consistently return around 7% after inflation historically.

This means in 20 years, you will have ~4x what you originally put in. Even better, you can support a 3% withdrawal rate in perpetuity. That means that if you have 2000 dollars invested, you can get 60 dollars per year forever! If you have 100,000, that’s 6000 per year forever!

The most common way to access stocks is through a retirement portfolio. There, you should invest in index funds, which represent a broad slice of the market.  This diversification across a wide range of assets is the best way to ensure you get consistent 7% (post-inflation) returns seen by the market as a whole.

The problem with index funds is that they invest in the entire index of the stock market. Some companies in the stock market may be doing evil things that you don’t want to support. OR you may have specific knowledge that makes you think some stocks will do better.

Instead of investing in an index fund, you can use new brokerages that offer no-cost trading to create portfolios that match indexes but are customized! Frr example, you could exclude oil companies, if you think oil is bad.

This also means that you actually own stock in these companies, and if you wanted, could vote and do other cool owner things. That makes you bourgeoisie. Being bourgeoisie is the American dream.
