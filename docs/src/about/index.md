## Why?

Fundiverse attempts to capture the best qualities of index funds - low fees, broad diversification, ease of use - while allowing you to customize your portfolio to your values and beliefs. It's the middle ground between picking stocks and picking the entire market.

::: tip
Fundiverse does not provide investment advice. It is a tool to help you build a portfolio that reflects your values and beliefs. All stock selections are your own.

## How

Your personalized index starts with an existing index as a base, which you can then customized by reweighting lists of stocks or individual stocks. Fundiverse then integrates with your brokerage to execute the orders to build your portfolio.

## Tell me More

Stocks - representing a share of ownership in one of the producing entities on capitalist society - have historically been one of the most consistent ways of building long-term wealth.

Modern stock investing emphasizes index funds for retail investers - "you can't beat the market". Fundiverse is based on the premise that this wisdom is correct; but that there is still room for personal preference and expression even when building a broadly diversified portfolio. Buying the market implicitly implies supporting every publically traded company equally - there are many reasons why some subset may be discounted or preferred by an investor besides pure financial goals.

To enable that, Fundiverse lets you take a common index fund, and tweak it. For example, you can exclude oil companies, or weight them more if you think they'll out-perform the market. You could exclude Amazon, Apple, or Meta.
