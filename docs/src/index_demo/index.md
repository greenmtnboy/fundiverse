## Custom Index Creation

The core feature of fundiverse is tailoring indexes to your goals. Creating your perfect index is simple. Select your base, your goal in dollars - and then make it yours by reweighting, adding, or removing using premade lists of stocks or single stocks.

[Download the app](../install) to make your index a reality. You can connect to your brokerage and place orders to bring the stocks you own in line with the portfolio you defined - or create multiple portfolios spanning different brokerages. 


::: tip
Uncomfortable starting with real money? Many brokerages support 'paper trading' using fake money; you can connect Fundiverse to these paper accounts to experiment and get a feel for what you want to do.
